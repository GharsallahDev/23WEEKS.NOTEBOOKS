This helped to focus on the most relevant information and improve the efficiency of data handling.\n\nAdding New Columns:\n\n- **Name Length**: We calculated the length of each name to provide an additional parameter for users who may prefer names of specific lengths.\n\n- **First Letter**: We extracted the first letter of each name, allowing users to filter names based on their starting letter.\n\n- **Transforming Name Format**: To maintain consistency and enhance readability, we transformed all names into InitCap format.\n\nThis formatting capitalizes the first letter of each name while keeping the remaining letters in lowercase, making the names visually appealing and standard across the dataset.\n\nThese preprocessing steps were crucial for refining the dataset and ensuring that the Baby Name Generator delivers accurate, well-organized, and easily accessible name suggestions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the existing CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('african_names.csv')\ndf.to_csv('african_names.csv', index=False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-28T11:07:50.216039Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-28T11:07:50.216426Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-28T11:07:50.235815Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-28T11:07:50.216390Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-28T11:07:50.234915Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\n\n# Load the existing CSV file\ndf = pd.read_csv('african_names.csv')\n\n# Drop the 'Sex' and 'Variations' columns\ndf = df.drop(columns=['Sex', 'Variations'])\n\n# Save the modified DataFrame back to the original CSV file\ndf.to_csv('african_names.csv', index=False)\nprint(\"Removed 'Sex' and 'Variations' columns from african_names.csv.\")\n\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-28T11:07:52.969182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-28T11:07:52.970022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-28T11:07:52.993124Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-28T11:07:52.969980Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-28T11:07:52.992228Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Removed 'Sex' and 'Variations' columns from african_names.csv.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df.head) ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-28T11:07:56.679037Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-28T11:07:56.679658Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-28T11:07:56.691910Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-28T11:07:56.679620Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-28T11:07:56.690930Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<bound method NDFrame.head of                  Category  Gender     Name               Origin  \\\n0     African -

Here’s an overview of the process:\n\n**Clustering Meanings**: We utilized a zero-shot classification model to categorize the meanings of names into predefined categories. This approach allows for flexible and dynamic classification without the need for a labeled training dataset specific to our categories.\n\n**Model Used**: facebook/bart-large-mnli from the Hugging Face Transformers library. This model is known for its ability to perform zero-shot classification, which is particularly useful for assigning meanings to categories without explicit training on those categories.\n\n**User Input Integration**: This categorization will be integrated into the Baby Name Generator, allowing users to input their desired categories or themes. The generator will then filter and suggest names that match those categories based on the meanings.\n\nBy leveraging zero-shot classification for meaning-based clustering, we have significantly enhanced the functionality of the Baby Name Generator, providing users with a powerful tool to find names that resonate with their personal and cultural preferences.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\n# Ensure there are no NaN or empty strings in the 'Meaning' column\ndf = df[df['Meaning'].notna() & (df['Meaning'].str.strip() != '')]\n\n# Define candidate labels for classification\ncandidate_labels = ['Nature', 'God', 'Intellectual Qualities', 'Virtues', 'Strength and Power', \n                    'Leadership and Royalty', 'Social Roles', 'Family relations', 'Birth Order', \n                    'Emotions', 'Objects', 'Time','Love']\n\n# Initialize the zero-shot classifier\nclassifier = pipeline(\"zero-shot-classification\", model=\"facebook/bart-large-mnli\")\n\n# Function to classify each relevant word (sentence in this case)\ndef classify_sentence(sentence, threshold=0.5):\n    if isinstance(sentence, str) and sentence.strip():  # Ensure sentence is a non-empty string\n        result = classifier(sentence, candidate_labels)\n        # Get the label with the highest score and its score\n        top_label = result['labels'][0]\n        top_score = result['scores'][0]\n        # Check if the top score meets the threshold\n        if top_score >= threshold:\n            return top_label\n        else:\n            return 'nothing'\n    return 'nothing'  # Return 'nothing' if classification fails\n\n# Apply the classification function to the 'Meaning' column\ndf['Category'] = df['Meaning'].apply(lambda x: classify_sentence(x))\n\n# Display the updated DataFrame\nprint(df.head(20))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-28T11:09:21.234378Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-28T11:09:21.234904Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-28T12:20:49.514241Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-28T11:09:21.234846Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-28T12:20:49.513168Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.15k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"7b37d35085ba448abd9538148c1cfe06"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"model.safetensors:   0%|          | 0.00/1.63G [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0e28dcc053b645558af472b51d27e476"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer_config.json:   0%|          | 0.00/26.0 [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"3273fc1f9c18475eb6be42eaa043c5ae"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"vocab.json:   0%|          | 0.00/899k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"121584da26cd450ea0e22567a01d3ee5"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"merges.txt:   0%|          | 0.00/456k [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"0494a1d3e3ef48259d3215aed77e9f34"}},"metadata":{}},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"tokenizer.json:   0%|          | 0.00/1.36M [00:00<?, ?B/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"05811b61de2a40f493868f612d4ccc18"}},"metadata":{}},{"name":"stderr","text":"/opt/conda/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py:1601: FutureWarning: `clean_up_tokenization_spaces` was not set.
